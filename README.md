## About the Project <a name="about-the-project"></a>

In today's competitive business landscape, retaining customers and ensuring their satisfaction are paramount to the success of any company. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses, as it directly impacts revenue and growth. Understanding why customers leave and predicting which ones are at risk of churning is crucial.

This data science project is dedicated to addressing the challenges of customer churn for a telecommunications company. The primary objectives include:

- **Comprehensive Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** We've delved deep into the available data to uncover hidden insights and ensure data quality. Refer to [EDA-1.ipynb](EDA-1.ipynb) and [preprocessing-2.ipynb](preprocessing-2.ipynb) for detailed exploration and preprocessing steps.

- **Machine Learning Model Building:** To predict customer churn accurately, we've built, trained, and rigorously evaluated various machine learning models. The journey through model development and selection is documented in [ML-model-3.ipynb](ML-model-3.ipynb).

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tuning models is essential to achieving peak performance. We've implemented hyperparameter optimization techniques to maximize predictive accuracy.

- **Results Visualization:** Communicating the results effectively is key. We've used data visualization techniques to showcase model performance and insights.

Understanding why customers churn and predicting potential churners enables businesses to implement targeted retention strategies, reduce revenue loss, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
